# Portfolio
 This is my portfolio of projects I have worked on within the field of the Digital Humanities. As I work on new projects, I will upload more files to this repository in the hopes to both showcase my abilities and provide future researchers with useful tools for their work. 
 
 My bakground is in Literature and Religious Studies (with a focus on Buddhism), so it is likely that my work will mainly focus on the application of digital tools to these fields.
 However, I hope to create scripts that can be applied to a wide range of subjects.
 
 I am still in the process of learning programming, and some of the earlier projects may have a lot of redundancies; as I continue to learn, I will update the scripts.

 Without further ado, here is what you can currently find in this repository:

 ## Text Analysis and Web Scraping
 As the name indicates, this Jupyter notebook focuses on scraping a website, in this case a Belgian website focused on Buddhism, and on producing text analysis from this website. For the web scraping, I used BeautifulSoup, whereas the text analysis itself is inspired in the Voyant Tools. The script is written in a way that anyone can easily use it by making the pertinent substitutions.

 ## Neural Network Abecedarian
 This Jupyter notebook focuses on producing abecedarian poems (poems in which each verse begins with the subsequent letter in the alphabet) by creating a neural network with the help of the Markovify library. Three different poetry corpuses were used, all of which can be found in the neural_abecedarian folder.

## IMDB SQL Exploration
Through a combination of MySQL, DataGrip, and a Jupyter notebook, a peer and I created an exploration of the IMDB database (up until 2008) of the gender division in film. In the imdb_sql folder you can find a ZIP file containing the IMDB database, which you can then load onto DataGrip and, by creating a connection with MySQL, query in your Jupyter notebook. We also created multiple visualizations of the data.
